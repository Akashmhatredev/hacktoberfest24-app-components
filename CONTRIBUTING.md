# Contribution Guide

## Goal
So the idea is to create a new component which will be used in mobile and web.

## Code

1. Add your new component in `quasar/src/components/`. Make sure to use appropriate name and path.
2. Prefer using Tailwind CSS for styling. You can still use plain CSS if you prefer.
3. You can use the sample images, or use your CREATIVITY for new components.

## Issues

1. Before creating an issue, check if someone has already worked on the component you want to create. You can still recreate the component if you want, but make sure the design is not too similar.
2. Create an issue with the component name.
3. Create a branch attached to that issue.

## Pull Requests
1. After you complete your design, create a pull request.
2. Check if there are any conflicts, If yes, then please solve them and push to same branch.
